Solo project ideas

1. Summary:
   Your cocktail recommender

   Build a CRUD website with API. It allows user look at random cocktail recepies. The website should only have one page. When open the website, it shows 10 cocktails by connecting to an API. Each element shows image,name,ingredient. Show more details when you click on the "more details" button, don't lead to a new page, instead, show a text box by the side. Details including whether it's alcoholic, type of glass, and instruction.

2. Details by CRUD

- Create: Login using MongoDB. Create two schemas, Users and Cocktails.
- Read: Get random cocktails suggestions thru API.
- Update: Update customized recipes
- Delete: delete custom recipes

3. Core feature priorities:

- Connect to API! and let 10 cocktails show on page. With basic info(name,image).
- Show more details when you click on the "more details" button, don't lead to a new page, instead, show a text box by the side. Details including whether it's alcoholic, type of glass, and instruction.
- Let user create their own cards. (Mongodb)
- let people delete their own cards
